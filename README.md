# React Practice App

This is a simple web application built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It was created to practice and learn React concepts, including components, state management, and hooks.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The app will automatically reload when you make changes to the source files.\
You can also view any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.\
This is useful for testing individual components or the app as a whole.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It optimizes the app for best performance and creates a minified version ready to be deployed.

### `npm run eject`

**Note**: This action is irreversible. Use it only if you need to customize the underlying configuration. It copies all build tools (e.g., Webpack, Babel) directly into your project for full control.
